## **Unreasonably Optimistic**

I’ve noticed something about restaurant owners who actually turn things around.

They’re unreasonably optimistic about what they can figure out.

Not delusional.  
Not arrogant.

They don’t assume everything will work.  
They just don’t let uncertainty stop them from trying.

That distinction matters more than most people realize.

You see it play out in small, everyday decisions. Not dramatic pivots. Not viral success stories. Just quiet forks in the road where one owner hesitates and another moves.

“We can’t afford help right now.”  
But you’re losing $8,000 a month because labor scheduling is still guesswork, built on habits instead of data.

“I don’t really get the AI thing.”  
Meanwhile another owner spends 20 minutes setting up automated catering quotes and frees up 15 hours a week they were previously losing to emails and follow-ups.

“I need to think about it.”  
Six months later, the same problems are still there. Same stress. Same bottlenecks. Just more expensive now.

The difference between these owners isn’t intelligence.  
It isn’t experience.  
It isn’t access to information.

It’s how they relate to uncertainty.

Most restaurant owners are extremely capable people. They’ve already done something hard. They’ve built a business in an industry that doesn’t forgive mistakes easily. But that same reality trains them to be cautious. Careful. Reasonable.

And on paper, that makes sense.

Margins are thin.  
Mistakes are costly.  
Time is scarce.

So owners wait. They research. They ask around. They look for reassurance that something will work before touching it.

The problem is that operations don’t reward certainty.  
They reward motion.

The owners who turn things around don’t wait to fully understand every variable. They’re willing to act while the picture is still a little blurry.

They test before they debate.  
They adjust instead of freezing.  
They accept that some attempts won’t pan out.

Half the time, they’re wrong.

A new process doesn’t stick.  
A system doesn’t get adopted.  
An idea sounds good but breaks down in real service.

They don’t romanticize that.  
They just don’t let it stop them.

Because the other half of the time?  
That’s where the shift happens.

That’s when labor stabilizes because scheduling is finally based on reality, not gut feel.  
That’s when managers stop firefighting because expectations are documented instead of assumed.  
That’s when owners get out of the building without everything unraveling behind them.

Progress in restaurants rarely comes from one big, perfect decision.

It comes from a series of imperfect attempts that compound over time.

Trying a different prep schedule.  
Testing a tighter invoicing process.  
Automating one repetitive admin task.  
Writing down one SOP that used to live only in someone’s head.

None of these feel revolutionary in the moment.  
Most feel slightly uncomfortable.  
Some feel unnecessary until they aren’t.

But together, they separate operators who are always reacting from those who are actually building something stable.

There’s a quiet confidence in owners who turn things around. Not because they know everything, but because they trust themselves to figure things out as they go.

They don’t need permission.  
They don’t wait for perfect timing.  
They don’t expect certainty upfront.

They understand that clarity usually comes *after* action, not before it.

Being reasonable feels safe.  
But in operations, it’s often expensive.

The owners who win aren’t reckless.  
They’re just willing to be wrong half the time.

And they know that’s the price of moving forward.
